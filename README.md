# pure-client

A client for the PURE API written in TypeScript/Node

## Development

Recommendation is to carry out development in the supplied `.devcontainer` configured environment

### Setup

- clone the repo
- add required environment variables e.g. [[see here]](https://containers.dev/) to a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` file
- build and start the [devContainer](https://containers.dev/)
- open a terminal in the devContainer and test with `npm run test`
- use `dummy_proj/*` for testing the locally built code base
